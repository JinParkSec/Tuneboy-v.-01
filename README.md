# Tuneboy v.0.1


A versatile Twitter bot powered by AI that tweets the latest updates, pictures, stats, and news about any K-pop idol or group. Running 24/7 on the Cloud, thanks to GitHub Actions, Tuneboy ensures you stay updated with your favorite K-pop stars.

Tuneboy gathers the most recent information about K-pop idols and groups from various sources like Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and more. Using the data scraped from the web and the known data stored in a YAML file, the bot intelligently decides and tweets updates.

The project is highly modular, and by editing the YAML file, you can easily fork this repo and create a bot for another group or artist with zero to minimal code changes.
